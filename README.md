Mixnode advertising good practices:
Delegation channels:
Delegators chat on discord
    This is a discord chat within the Nym Discord channel where mixnodes runners can share messages advertising their mixnodes to people who are looking for mixnodes to delegate to.

    You can send your mixnode message through this form and it can be sent once every 7 days. Take a look at the other messages sent there and try to come up with one for your mixnode.

Delegators telegram group
    Very similar to the delegators chat on Discord, this is a delegators group on Telegram where mixnodes can advertise themselves to delegators.

    To get your mixnode on the group you can send the advertising message through a DM to either merve, evgeny or sudo. Check out the messages sent there and try to come up with one for your mixnode.

Mixnode branding:
Mixnode Name:
    The name of your mixnode should be easy to associate with your community contributions, this way people in the community who are familiar with your work will easily associate your mixnode with your work.

Mixnode description:
    Your mixnode description should be a concise text about your mixnode advantages and reasons why the delegators should trust their nym tokens to your node.

    Utilize the link to redirect people to a page or document where you can showcase more of your node’s advantage, purpose or contributions. But don’t forget that the main message should be passed in the description, not everyone is gonna visit the link.

Community participation/contribution:
    This is one of the most efficient ways of advertising your mixnode, by contributing and participating in the community you will add credibility to your mixnode and have a better chance of attracting delegators.

    So be it through blog posts, tutorials, videos, memes, helping other people in the chat or whatever way you feel you can contribute the most to the community make sure to associate your mixnode with that work. This way people who are affected by your contributions know they can retribute through delegating to your mixnode.
